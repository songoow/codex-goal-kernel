const INSTRUCTIONS = `## What to return

Perform the workspace changes first, then return one JSON object as your final response:

{
  "closed": ["<predicate ids you believe now hold>"],
  "new_todos": [{"id":"t3","title":"...","done_when":"...","advances":"<predicate id>"}],
  "new_assumptions": [{"id":"a1","statement":"...","source":{"kind":"file","path":"...","sha256":"<sha256 of that file now>"}}],
  "proposed_amendment": {"objective":"...","reason":"..."} | null,
  "note": "one short sentence"
}

Reporting and verification rules:
- Only claim a predicate in "closed" if the workspace now actually satisfies it; the harness re-runs all checks, revokes stale passes, and ignores unverified claims.
- New todos and repeated passes do not count as progress. A checkpoint earns progress only the first time it passes. Repair regressed work and continue toward the remaining checkpoints.
- Every todo you add must set "advances" to a predicate id declared above. A todo that names no declared predicate is rejected. You must also keep the actual work within the objective; the id check does not establish semantic relevance.
- "proposed_amendment" is for changing the objective. It does not take effect: the run stops and asks the owner. Do not use it to restate work as done.
- Report only what this turn actually changed on disk or in reality.`;
