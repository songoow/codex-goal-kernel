 *   goal/1.0.0.json          current declaration (changed only by explicit amendment)
 *   state.json               the whole mutable state, a few KB
 *   journal.jsonl            append-only receipts, one line per turn
 *   VIEW.md                  deterministic human/agent-readable projection
 *
 * There is deliberately no index, cache, lease, lock file or second store.
 * Everything the loop needs between turns fits in `state.json`, so a fresh
 * process (or a fresh session days later) reconstructs the loop by reading two
 * files instead of trusting prose from a previous run.
